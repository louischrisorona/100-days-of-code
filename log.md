# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 12th, 2020
##### 

Worked on reviewing my Express knowledge. Learned that we can utilize the route method on the app object. It helps reduce redundancies on creating separate routes for each HTTP request verb



### Day 2: July 13th - 14th, 2020
##### 

Brushing up on my vanilla javascript skills by implementing a simple mortgage payment calculator.

**Thoughts**: It could definitely use a facelift with some CSS. Perhaps tomorrow I can spruce it up.

### Day 3: July 14th - 15th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went back into my mortgage calculator to add an amortization schedule. Still need a little tweaking on the algorithm.

**Thoughts** Need to tweak the styling for the amortization schedule table. Going back to use vanilla js is so much harder than I remember.
